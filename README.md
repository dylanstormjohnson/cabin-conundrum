## Description

- This project was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Node.js, MySQL.  I was motivated to build this project because we wanted to learn more about MVC project formatting and construction.  It was built because we decided to make a point-and-click adventure game in the browser that is capable of saving one's time against others.  In making said project, I learned a lot about MVC and how it can be a useful way to organize information.

## Features

- When the game window is clicked, the game is opened up to the first room and the objects therein are placed.

- By clicking on arrows or doors, they can be used to traverse to different rooms to explore the cabin to find a way out.

- By clicking on an item, that item is moved to one's inventory for later use.

- By clicking on an item in one's inventory, the item is highlighted, indicating that it will be used on whatever thing is clicked next.

- When the right item is used on the right thing, an action occurs (i.e.: a door opening, things being moved around etc.) which allows for progression towards the end of the game.
