Cabin Conundrum

This point and click escape room adventure game will test your skills at finding clues and solving puzzles to escape from a mysterious cabin.


This is a simple point and click game application. Utilizes handlebars.js, MySQL, jQuery, Anime.js, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to implement functionality. All of the game play images were created by Storm using PhotoShop. Background images were generated with the assistance of AI. 

Some of the challenges we encountered were learning Anime.js specifically for this project and implementing both background and sprite images as interactive components. Maintaining item image alignment over the background image. As well as finding a way to make those images clickable objects.

Future hopes for the game would be to add levels that lead to more complex layouts, and intricate puzzles.
